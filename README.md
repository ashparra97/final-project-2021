# Final Project - Earthquake Prediction
### By Ashley, Jason, Kellen, Kimberly, Rosa

## Abstract

Earthquake threat is real, and it affects millions of people everyday. Along with the shock and awe of the shockwave itself, potential tsunamis pose several threats. There have been records of cities and regions damaged by earthquakes that are subsequently destroyed by the tsunami that follows (see Fukushima Incident), resulting in devastating consequences in terms of loss of life and monetary damage. Therefore, we want to help predict when the next earthquake will be, whether it will cause a tsunami, and the probable location of where they will occur or are most likely. Using tools like machine learning libraries and Tableau, we want to tell a story about earthquakes and answer some of the questions we have.

## Data Sources
Instead of gathering data ourselves (very counterproductive), we will be using the data collected by USGS in the following formats:

- Earthquake data from USGS:
    - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson
- Earthquake data download from USGS
    - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv
- Documentation 
    - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php
